# Stay-Fit_RPG
An Android multiplayer application designed as part of a project for my final year at City Unversity.
The application uses hardware sensors to track physical activites of users such as Sit-ups, Push-ups, Running etc.
Completing exercises upgrades the user's character, which makes them stronger and gives them new skills based on the exercises completed.

Users can choose to compete against others users in the form of turn-based battles between their characters. Participating in battles rewards the user's with in-game currency which can be used to purchase cosmetics for their characters.
