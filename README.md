# Stay-Fit_RPG
And Android application designed as part of a project for my final year at City Unversity.
The application uses hardware sensors in order to allow the user to complete exercises such as Situps, Pushups, Squats and Running.
Completing exercises will increase the character's power, this character can be used to battle other users online.
